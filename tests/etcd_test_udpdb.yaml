# The pipeline is designed to build around a ring buffer.
# A ring buffer is created at the startup of a pipeline.
# The parameters in this section 1) defines the ring buffer.
#                                2) defines pipeline behaviours.
# Some of them are used by applications to build the pipeline.

basic:
  # Application to run for this section, including directory and fixed options
  # Any application configuration which are not shared with other applications
  app:    dada_db -p -n 2
  key:    dada       # The ring buffer key in hex
  
  writer:    udpdb_simulator  # Ring buffer writer, only one writer
  reader:    dbdisk  # We can have multiple readers, split with space

  # Additional applications to rn the pipeline
  # These applications are related with specific reader or writer
  # For example, only 'search' needs average/calibration/uvgrid
  # ETCD configuration script does not check the correctness of accessory
  # pipeline script checks it and errors out when anything is wrong
