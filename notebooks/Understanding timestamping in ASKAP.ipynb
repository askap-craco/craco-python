    "# Understanding timestamping in  ASKAP\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is a painful and possibly contraversial topic, but here goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two timestamps flying around ASKAP:\n",
    "- Binary Atomic Time (BAT) - this is the number of microseconds since MJD=0 (i.e. MJD=JD - 2400000.5) in the atomic reference frame (i.e. no leap seconds). This timestamp is not does not strictly align with askap sample times becuase ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frame ID (FID) is the number of \"samples\" since the system was reset. The number of samples is at rate of the course filterbank which is 1 MHz but oversampled by 32/27, i.e. the coarse filterbank period is 1us * 27/32. If you're samples are after the fine filterbank (which CRACO is) then further reduced by a factor of 64 from the fine filterbank. I.e. the \"frame ID\" period is 1us * 27/32 * 64\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sytem is \"Synced\" (e.g. an operator presses the \"Sync Reset\") button in the GUI, the software tells everything to start at a particular BAT a few seconds in the future. When everything starts, the frame ID is set to zero and off it goes. Frame IDs are generally passed around with the data - the first part where frame IDs are assigned to data is at the digital reciever, after the samples are channelised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worse, the hardware doesn't actually pass around enough bits of BAT to unambiguously know the time - you have to work it out from the context, by which I mean, roughly what day it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also FYI: The ASKAP correlator and beamformer operate on \"banks\" of 2048 fine filterbank samples, which is equivalent ot 110 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with that hopeless introduction out of the way, let's look at some data.\n"
